Proposal:
I want to build a graphical window manager for our OS. This will
started by init and will the main user process.  It can be used to spawn
windows, which will default open to a shell. It will act like a tiling window
manager in the sense that the screen will always be used entirely. The space
will be evenly divided between all the current screens, and dynamically divide
as more windows are open.

This will require: 
+ Drawing to screen (probably requires switching to graphic mode at boot)
+ Writing text to screen (instead of over serial)
+ Creating the concept of windows
+ Creating the concept of focused window
+ Create a way for the user to switch windows

What I have so far is totally preliminary and for fun, but it is indicative of what I want to do:

Very simple window system
Drawing to the VGA memory
Getting input (still from serial at the moment)
Some basic wrapping (want to rewrite)

PS: You can run it with `make run`
