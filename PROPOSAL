Proposal:
I want to build a graphical window manager for our OS. This will
started by init and will the main user process.  It can be used to spawn
windows, which will default open to a shell. It will act like a tiling window
manager in the sense that the screen will always be used entirely. The space
will be evenly divided between all the current screens, and dynamically divide
as more windows are open.

This will require: 
+ Drawing to screen (probably requires switching to graphic mode at boot)
+ Writing text to screen (instead of over serial)
+ Creating the concept of windows
+ Creating the concept of focused window
+ Create a way for the user to switch windows

What do you think of the idea? Do you think it is feasible for me to do this?
